# ContextWeaver

**ContextWeaver** is a command-line tool designed to help developers package and share their codebase with Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.
When you want to ask an AI tool about your code, itâ€™s often hard to know what and how much to copy. 

ContextWeaver solves this by:
- Scanning your repository or selected files
- Collecting metadata and structure automatically
- Embedding file contents into a single, organized text document
- Supporting filtering (--include, --exclude), size limits, and token counts so you can fine-tune what gets included.
  
The result is a ready-to-share snapshot of your repo that you can paste into an LLM for debugging, documentation, or collaboration.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kkrishnan10/ContextWeaver
cd ContextWeaver
# virtual env
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Usage

```bash
# Analyze current directory
python src/main.py .

# Analyze a specific directory
python src/main.py ./src

# Analyze specific files
python src/main.py src/main.py README.md

# Save output to a file
python src/main.py . -o snapshot.txt

# Estimate token count (~chars/4) printed to stderr
python src/main.py . --tokens

# Only include certain file patterns (comma-separated)
python src/main.py . --include "*.py,*.md"
```
## Features

### Verbose Mode

```bash
# Show progress messages to stderr while scanning
python src/main.py . --verbose
# or shorter
python src/main.py . -V
```
### Line Numbers

```bash
# Prefix each line of file content with its 1-based line number
python src/main.py . --line-numbers
# or shorter
python src/main.py . -l
```
### Combined Usage

```bash
# Enable both verbose logging and line numbers
python src/main.py . -V -l
```
