# ContextWeaver

**ContextWeaver** is a command-line tool designed to help developers package and share their codebase with Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.
When you want to ask an AI tool about your code, itâ€™s often hard to know what and how much to copy. ContextWeaver automates this process by scanning your files, filtering relevant content, and combining everything into a single, ready-to-share document.

ContextWeaver solves this by:
- Scanning your repository or selected files
- Collecting metadata and structure automatically
- Embedding file contents into a single, organized text document
- Supporting filtering (--include, --exclude), size limits, and token counts so you can fine-tune what gets included.
  
The result is a ready-to-share snapshot of your repo that you can paste into an LLM for debugging, documentation, or collaboration.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kkrishnan10/ContextWeaver
cd ContextWeaver
# virtual env
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Usage

```bash
# Analyze current directory
python src/main.py .

# Analyze a specific directory
python src/main.py ./src

# Analyze specific files
python src/main.py src/main.py README.md

# Save output to a file
python src/main.py . -o snapshot.txt

# Estimate token count (~chars/4) printed to stderr
python src/main.py . --tokens

# Only include certain file patterns (comma-separated)
python src/main.py . --include "*.py,*.md"

# Generate a snapshot of your codebase
python3 src/main.py . -V -l --tokens --include=*.py,*.md -o snapshot.txt

```
## Features

### Verbose Mode

```bash
# Show progress messages to stderr while scanning
python src/main.py . --verbose
# or shorter
python src/main.py . -V
```
### Line Numbers

```bash
# Prefix each line of file content with its 1-based line number
python src/main.py . --line-numbers
# or shorter
python src/main.py . -l
```
### Combined Usage

```bash
# Enable both verbose logging and line numbers
python src/main.py . -V -l
```

## What's New in Refactored 0.1

In this refactored version, the codebase has been redesigned for **maintainability**, **readability**, and **extensibility**.  
The main improvements include:

- **Separated CLI logic** into `src/cli.py`  
- **Introduced modular file scanning and filtering** (`scanner.py`, `filters.py`)  
- **Added utility helpers** for clean I/O and formatting (`utils.py`, `formatter.py`)  
- **Improved variable naming** and reduced duplication  
- **Enhanced argument parsing** for better usability  

These changes make ContextWeaver easier to maintain and prepare it for future enhancements such as automated testing and configuration file support.
