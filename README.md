# ContextWeaver

**ContextWeaver** is a command-line tool designed to help developers package and share their codebase with Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.
When you want to ask an AI tool about your code, itâ€™s often hard to know what and how much to copy. 

ContextWeaver solves this by:
- Scanning your repository or selected files
- Collecting metadata and structure automatically
- Embedding file contents into a single, organized text document
- Supporting filtering options like file patterns and recent changes
- Providing size limits and token counts so you can fine-tune what gets included
  
The result is a ready-to-share snapshot of your repo that you can paste into an LLM for debugging, documentation, or collaboration.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kkrishnan10/ContextWeaver
cd ContextWeaver
# virtual env
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Usage

```bash
# Analyze current directory
python src/main.py .

# Analyze a specific directory
python src/main.py ./src

# Analyze specific files
python src/main.py src/main.py README.md

# Save output to a file
python src/main.py . -o snapshot.txt

# Estimate token count (~chars/4) printed to stderr
python src/main.py . --tokens

# Only include certain file patterns (comma-separated)
python src/main.py . --include "*.py,*.md"

# Only include files modified in the last 7 days
python src/main.py . --recent

# Short form of recent flag
python src/main.py . -r

# Combine recent filter with output file
python src/main.py . --recent -o recent-changes.txt
```

## Features

### Recent Changes Filter
The `--recent` (or `-r`) flag filters the output to only include files that have been modified within the last 7 days. This is particularly useful when:
- Working with large codebases and wanting to focus on active development areas
- Sharing recent changes with team members or AI assistants
- Debugging issues related to recent modifications

When using the recent filter, ContextWeaver will:
- Show modification timestamps for each file (e.g., "Modified: 2 hours ago")
- Display the total number of recent files found
- Add a note in the summary indicating recent filtering is active
