                <h3>Historical Information</h3>
                <p>
                    Thailand has a rich history, dating back to the Sukhothai Kingdom (13th century), which is considered the foundation of Thai culture.
                    Later, the Ayutthaya Kingdom (1350-1767) made Thailand a powerful trading hub in Southeast Asia. The kingdom flourished for over 400 years
                    before being invaded by the Burmese. Today, you can visit Ayutthaya Historical Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, to see ancient temples,
                    palaces, and statues.
                    Unlike many neighboring countries, Thailand was never colonized by European powers. This helped it preserve its culture, traditions, and
                    monarchy. The Grand Palace in Bangkok, built in 1782, remains one of the most famous landmarks in Thailand, attracting millions of visitors
                    each year.

                <h3>Popular Folklore</h3>
                <p>
                    Thai culture is filled with legends and myths that shape its traditions. Here are two famous stories:

                    Mae Nak (The Ghost of Phra Khanong) – This is Thailand’s most famous ghost story. Mae Nak was a devoted wife who 
                    died in childbirth while her husband was away at war. When he returned, her ghost tried to keep him from knowing the truth. 
                    Today, you can visit her shrine at Wat Mahabut in Bangkok, where locals leave offerings.
                    The Naga Serpent – In Thai mythology, Nagas are mythical serpents that live in the Mekong River. They are believed to be 
                    guardians of temples and rivers. Every year, during the Naga Fireball Festival, glowing fireballs are said to rise from the 
                    river, adding to the mystery.
