## Lab 3 Worklog

### Issue #3 – Verbose Mode
- Created branch `issue-3-verbose`.
- Added `--verbose/-V` flag to print progress to stderr.
- Updated `get_all_files()` to log directories and files as they were processed.
- Verified with `python3 -m src.main . -V`.

### Issue #4 – Line Numbers
- Created branch `issue-4-line-numbers`.
- Added `--line-numbers/-l` flag to prefix file output lines with numbers.
- Added helper function `with_line_numbers()`.
- Verified with `python3 -m src.main . -l`.

### Merging
- Merged `issue-3-verbose` into `main` after rebasing on the updated branch.
- Merged `issue-4-line-numbers` into `main`.  
- Encountered conflicts in `src/main.py` because both branches modified argument parsing and file output.  
- Resolved by combining both features into a single final file.  
- Verified both flags together with `python3 -m src.main . -V -l`.

### Outcome
- `main` branch now contains both features.
- Issues #3 and #4 closed with links to merge commit.
- Lessons: working in parallel branches makes conflicts likely if modifying the same files. Rebase helps keep history clean. Conflict resolution requires carefully merging both feature sets without losing functionality.
